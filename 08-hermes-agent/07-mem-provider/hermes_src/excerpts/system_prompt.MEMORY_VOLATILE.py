    prompt is stable across all turns in a session, maximizing prefix cache
    hits.

    then session-stable context files, then per-call volatile content
    (memory, USER profile, timestamp).  The whole string is treated as
    one cached block 鈥?Hermes never rebuilds or reinjects parts of it
    mid-session, which is the only way to keep upstream prompt caches
    warm across turns.
